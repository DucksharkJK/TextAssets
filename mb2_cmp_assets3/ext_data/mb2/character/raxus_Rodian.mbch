Details:
The Rodians of planet Rodia are a species of green-skinned humanoids found throughout the galaxy. The Rodian culture is marked by a reverence for the hunt, and once the green-skinned humanoids had cleared the jungles of all sizable predators, they turned to hunting one another.  Many Rodians have turned their passion towards the professional game working for the highest bidder."
