Details:

Tavion's connections with the Imperial Remnant gave her access to the still numerous Imperial Stormtroopers that still serve. Despite Tavion's attempts to transform all of her subordinates into force weilding cultists, the majority of her forces remain as Stormtroopers. These stormtroopers have been ordered to guard the dark force generator at all costs. They come armed with basic battle Armor as well as the E-11 Blaster rifle and an side arm, and their primary advantage is their vast numbers."
