INSTALLATION

$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$

Replace the .txd and .dff of an SA ped in GTA3.img
with the .txd and .dff included in this mod package
and you're done :).

_______________________________________________

How do you know which ped to replace? A small tutorial:

First, you need to download the "Ped Editor"-tool by
Scream2k4. GTAGarage link:

http://www.gtagarage.com/mods/show.php?id=5841

Fire up the programme and set your GTA location.
Choose a ped from the list of peds at the left
side of the programme; you can see how it looks
in the right side of the screen. In the middle
you see a list of settings. 
It displays a DFF-File name and a TXD-file name.
Open GTA3.img with IMG-Tool, search for those
DFF and TXD and replace them with the DFF and
TXD included in this mod package.

You're done :)!
