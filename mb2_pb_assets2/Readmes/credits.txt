//	Special thanks:

//	 Lervish - For donating his silly creations to this project and fixing a few model/animation issues
//	 Pipex - debugging .mbch stuff + helping me get on my feet with FA editing
//	 Biggus Dickus - mapping support
//	 Sweg - modeling support
//	 Yeet Master, Besus, Rebel, Norman - Sound additions. You made a painful process a very hilarious and fun one
//	 Frost - your work on the unfinished Marvel FA which inspired a lot of the cool effects/models Marvel-related
// 	 Plasma - Your extensive work in the Movie Game Map Pack helped me immensely when getting started on this FA!
//	 Spaghetti - Cleaning up my mess and helping me with release. You're super generous with your time and I'm honored to have you as an ally.

//	Biggest thanks to my clanmates within {EW} The  Elite Warriors for supporting me in this stupid venture. 
//	I would have given up had it not been for your love and attention.
