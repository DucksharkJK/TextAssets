Details:

Shasa was a Force-sensitive Selkath female who lived during the Jedi Civil War. After the Sith brainwashed Shasa and the Selkath youth, she refused to accept anything negative toward the Sith and was convinced that the Sith were victims of Republic lies and half-truths. When she learned that the Sith had tortured and killed her childhood friend Galas, Shasa was initially reluctant to believe this revelation, but she eventually accepted the truth and apologized to Revan for doubting him. Following Malak's death at a redeemed Revan's hands in the Jedi Civil War's final battle, Shasa founded an order of Force adepts that survived for close to four thousand years.
