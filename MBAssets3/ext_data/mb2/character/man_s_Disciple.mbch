Details:

The Order of Shasa took its name from a Force-sensitive Selkath named Shasa that the Sith had lured, along with her friends, to the Sith Embassy on Manaan. The Sith planned to use the impressionable Selkath to overthrow the Manaan government, and replace it with the easily-manipulated young Force trainees. However, the plot was uncovered by Revan, and he successfully convinced the Selkath of the Sith's evil nature.
