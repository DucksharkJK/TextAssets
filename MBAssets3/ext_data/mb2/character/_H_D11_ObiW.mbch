A dedicated and legendary Jedi, Obi-Wan Kenobi has had a long and tumultuous career that shaped the fate of an entire galaxy. He fought many battles alongside his apprentice and blood brother, Anakin Skywalker in the final years of the Old Republic. When Skywalker was corrupted by the dark side of the force, Kenobi was tragically forced to duel his former friend and left him dismembered and burning on Mustafar. In exile on Tatooine, Obi-Wan would watch over Luke, the son of Anakin, now Darth Vader. It was there that he would also learn the path to immortality, and demonstrate this to Vader in their final duel. In the afterlife, the two would meet again as friends."
