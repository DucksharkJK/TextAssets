description	"Han Solo

Class: Hero.
Class Summary: 
A quick-throwing stun-grenadier and pistoleer. 

Weaponry:
- DL-44 Blaster Pistol (Pistol 3 with expanded clipsize)
- Concussion Grenades (2)
- Stun Grenades (3) (Secondary-Fire only Frag Grenades, detonates on contact with surfaces)

Attributes:
- Heal (3)

Abilities:
- Dodge (3) [Class Special 1]

If, at the height of his smuggling days, you told Han Solo that he would be a hero of the Rebellion, fall in love with an Alderaanian princess, and become a general in the Alliance, he would have had no shortage of smart remarks for you. But if anything is consistent in Solo's life, it is unpredictability."
